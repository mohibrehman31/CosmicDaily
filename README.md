## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmicdaily.git
   cd cosmicdaily
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```
   npm i -g pnpm
   cd frontend && pnpm install
   cd ../backend && pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
     NODE_ENV=development
     ```

4. Start the development servers:

   ```
   # In the backend directory
   npm run dev

   # In the frontend directory
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Accessing Your Application

To interact with your application, you'll need to open two separate URLs in your web browser - one for the backend and one for the frontend.

## Backend Access
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. This will connect you to the backend server

## Frontend Access
1. Open a new tab or window in your web browser
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/`
3. This will load the frontend user interface

**Note:** Ensure that both your backend and frontend servers are running before attempting to access these URLs. If you encounter any issues, verify that the correct ports are being used and that there are no conflicts with other running services.

## Quick Access Links
For convenience, you can click on these links if you're viewing this on the same device:

- [Open Backend](http://localhost:3000)
- [Open Frontend](http://localhost:5173/)
